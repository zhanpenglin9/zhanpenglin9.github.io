This is the first time I have ever encountered Bootstrap, and I can see how it can save time and trouble when writing HTML code and designing a website or UI. But as I use it I also did find some limits it can have espically when you want something to look exactly how you want it to be.<br><br><br><br><br><br>


## Advantages

The biggest advantage I found when using bootstrap is how convenient all the pre-built classes it is. Things like row and col can make things a lot easier when you want to orginzed different items like images and blocks of text. It can help you keep things in place and organize different items and elements without worrying too much about them "pushing" each other around.

Other things like the built-in padding, margin, dropdown, container, and many other useful classes can make the prossess of building a UI or webpage a lot smoother. It can save vaulable time from writing css and can keep the file look more orginized and less messy. It can also make it easier to keep everything consistent, especially with things like the container, row, and col classes.  

## Limits

Some limits I encounter when using Bootstrap is that even though many things like row, col, and container are exptremely useful, there are still some things you need to use css for if you want something to look exaclty how you want. 

Things like a certain size and length for images and margins, or if you want an element at an exact part of the page, it might be easier to just write the CSS yourself. These more specific goals might be easier to achieve when just using CSS. There's defenitly ways to use bootstrap to get a smiliar or even identcal effect, but since everything is pre-buit it's defenitly better at competing more broad design compare to getting everyhting to the closest pixle.  

## Overall View

Overall, Bootstrap is a great tool for building webpages and UI. Many of the classes it offers are really useful in many common situations and can generally save a lot of time. Using classes like row and container can help you divide up your code in to different sections so you don't need to worry too much about them getting in the way of each other long as you use them correctly.

All in all, it's a really useful tool that can save programmers a lot of time from writing CSS when learnt and used correctly. Even if it can't do everything, the classes it provides can still help make the process a whole lot easier and smoother.
