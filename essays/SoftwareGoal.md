Ever since I heard of the concept of coding when I was still in elementary I was interested in the concept. But during that time, I always viewed it as something that was a bit out of reach. Since the idea of programming with ones and zeros sounds like a headache to me at the time. 

However, that changed after I took my first coding class during high school. That class helped me get a better idea of what coding is actually like, and it showed me that maybe it's not that far out of my reach as I thought.

## Start of coding

The start of my interest in coding started with my love of video games when I was young. I always found the idea of being able to design and create a world with code fascinating. This was what sparked my interest in this field. Later in high school, I was able to experience what actual coding feels like, and that drew me in even more. 

It showed me that coding wasn't just about trying to memorize thousands of different syntax, but more about using and developing different functions and tools for problem-solving. I loved the process of designing my own program to do certain tasks. Even though the process of debugging the code can be frustrating at times but it's also really rewarding when I'm finally able to find the problem and fix it. 

It can sometimes be hard to get going with a new coding project, but once I was able to start getting a few lines of code in, I often find myself getting really immersed in the process. This was especially the case when it came to personal projects, and this is what really rooted my interest in coding and software development. 

## Current Goals and Hope for Growth

My current goals for growing in software development are to be able to get more familiar with different types of coding language and setups. I want to be able to get to the point where I'm able to be given a coding language and be able to pick it up and start coding at my normal level in a few hours at most. 

Another thing I want to be able to learn is more about different fields of software development, like web design. I want to be able to understand and work on all types of programs and software, and not just be familiar with a few aspects of programming.

But the thing I most want to be able to work on is skills related to game development, since that's where my interest in coding sprouted from and is still the thing that I'm most interested in currently. 

## Hope for the future

My current plan for the future is to keep honing my programming skills and work on getting used to working on different types of projects. I would like to be able to get an entry-level job in programming after graduating from college and getting my degree. I would like to gain more coding experience this way and improve my skills as a programmer, and look for different opportunities along the way. 

After this, I would like to be able to also work on some personal projects, and if things worked well, build a career I can live off and enjoy with the information and skills I learn over the years.

I believed that this is the path I would like to go down, that I would enjoy, and ultimately be able to build a career out of.
