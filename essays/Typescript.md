This is the first time I have ever used TypeScript, and my initial impression is that it feels quite different from what I'm accustomed to. However, there are also many familiar elements to other programming languages I have used in the past. Overall, it feels decently new but still manageable.<br><br><br><br><br><br>


## The Differences

One of the biggest differences I found interesting about TypeScript is the way it handles datatypes. For most of the coding languages I use, before we needed to include a datatype or else the code will usually throw an error. But Typescript threw a curveball with it being able to work even without explicitly including the datatype. I understand it's still a good idea to include it anyway, but I did find it really interesting that it will allow you to create a variable without including the datatype yourself.

Another interesting concept I found is the idea of vari, let, and const. Before, I was used to being restricted to only allowing one variable to a certain name. The way the transcript allows me to choose if I want to do that and being able to create 2 variables of the same name seems interesting to me. I can see how it might be useful at times, but it can also cause many unintended issues, which is why let and const can be really useful. Still, I like that this is still an option. 

The layout and syntax also feel pretty different from other languages I've learn before, like Python, Java, and C, but it should be fine after getting used to it a bit. 

## Similar

Even though a lot of the syntax of Typescript looks different from what I'm used to, and it also allows for more options in design, the basics of the language seem to be similar to most other languages. The basic datatypes seem to be the same, and you can also still create classes and objects in TypeScript. 

Typescript still has all the basic components of other coding languages I've used and learn before, just with a different emphasis on different parts.

## Overall View

Overall, I feel like TypeScript is an interesting coding language that feels decently different from what I have used before. So far, I would say I like the way it's set up and can understand at least the basics of it well. The only thing I'm having trouble with so far is some of the strange syntax it includes to shorten or is meant to make code more readable. I saw some of this syntax in [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#basic-javascript), specifically the ES6 section. It took me a while to understand what it was trying to convey, but I think with time and practice, I should be able to understand what it is saying.

In short, TypeScript is a really new language to me, especially some of the weird syntax it includes. But with time, I feel optimistic that I can learn and understand how and where I would use this coding language.
