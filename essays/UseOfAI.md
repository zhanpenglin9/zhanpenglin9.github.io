## I. Introduction

AI is a really new tool for many different fields, and one of them is education. It's a tool that can understand what you're trying to look for and summarize the information for you quickly, saving you the hassle of googling everything and trying to find a match. However, this can also become of handiness when the AI gets misinformation or makes a mistake, so one can lose the skill to do research without it. The AI I had used for this call is ChatGPT<br><br><br><br><br><br>


## II. Personal Experience with AI

1. Experience WODs, e.g., E18
   - I had used ChatGPT to experience WODs before, but I didn't find it too useful. This was because we had a video that went over everything a lot more clearly already. The only time I found it useful was when something went wrong that the video didn't cover.
2. In-class Practice WODs
   - I try not to use AI much for these ones since they aren't graded till the end of the day, so I like having them as practice.
3. In-class WODs
   - I had used ChatGPT for this many times, and I did find it really useful, mostly just because of the time limit. Under the pressure, it's really hard to calmly debug issues, especially near the end of the time limit, so it became really helpful.
4. Essays
   - I didn't use AI for my essays besides making a list of titles, and then I would try to find inspiration in them. I found it not that useful when trying to write essays besides maybe pasting text into Google Docs for auto-correct. 
5. Final project
   - I found AI to be really useful in this project. There were numerous unexpected bugs and issues that arose. Some of them were styling errors, and others were logical errors. But without AI, I probably would have had to spend a lot more time googling to find the reason why there's an issue and find solutions. 
6. Learning a concept / tutorial
   - I found AI to be a bit of a double-edged sword on this, since it can help summarize and find the key points really quickly. But this can also cause one to lose some of the details in the process and not be able to memorize things as clearly as if you went through all the hassle and trouble of reading the vague and confusing wording in the textbooks. 
7. Answering a question in class or in Discord
   - I have not checked the Discord question a lot, so I'm not sure how AI would impact this.  This is because I haven't really used the smart question tab a lot
8. Asking or answering a smart-question
   - I haven't used this a lot, so I'm not sure about the impact of AI on this. This is because I haven't really used the smart question tab a lot
9. Coding example, e.g., “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”
    - This is a good way to use AI to understand how a code can work. I have tried asking ChatGPT to give me an example of how a code would work with different inputs, and it would tell me why it can work or why it wont. This can help me understand the details of a line of code and its limitations.
10. Explaining code
    - As stated above, in my experience, AI is a great tool for this. It can look at a specific line of code and explain why it works and when it won't. Although I have found sometimes it can have some issues and logic errors when explaining, so sometimes you need to double-check.
11. Writing code
    - I found Ai to be really useful when trying to write code as well. You can ask it for different ideas of how to design a code or ask it what function would work best with it, depending on how much you want it to help you with. But the code sometimes can be a bit incapable with other files in a project, so it can take a few tries to find the right solution if you don't have a clear answer in your mind already.
12. Documenting code
    - I wasn't too focused on this part when using AI, but it does document all the code it pops out really well. Sometimes too well that it had styling issues, but overall, I say it's a really good tool if you want to learn how to style and document code properly. 
13. Quality assurance, e.g., What’s wrong with this code, or Fix the ESLint errors 
    - I found AI really useful in these cases as well. The reason it gives for the errors and issues is usually correct. The only thing is you need to make sure it has all the information and all the files that can be affected by the code or else the solution can be misleading. 
14. Other uses in ICS 314 not listed
    - Some other uses I found useful are trying to find out  why something works. Like when given code from online sources, it can be really useful to ask AI why this code can work, because sometimes the explanation given isn't really clear. 


## III. Impact on Learning and Understanding

I found this to be a bit two-sided for AI. Since on one hand, it can really help explain and reexplain confusing topics. But on the other hand, your understanding might still be better when (if) you decrypt it on your own. But there are also times when you just can't understand it, which is when AI can be really helpful. Overall, I feel like the impact of AI on learning and understanding depends a lot more on the attitude of the user and the process they use it. If the user wants to learn the subject, then AI is a great tool, but if not, then AI can be a hindrance. 

## IV. Practical Applications

Some uses of AI in other places can be for organizing information with different reports. As long as the information of the report is clearly written, there are AI that can take it and sort them into a standardized format. Some other uses include helping with running simulations of experiments and analyzing data. 

## V. Challenges and Opportunities

I found a big problem with AI is that it's sometimes hard to explain what you want with it. Similar to not being sure how to best google search for an answer. AI, compared to Google, is a lot better in that regard, but there are still times when it's difficult to get what you want. Another issue is that if the AI chat gets too long with too many replies, it starts to confuse itself. As for future opportunities, I find it might be nice to find a way to fit AI into a class instead of needing to find ways to limit it. Sure, right now there's not a good way to do it, but I'm sure there must be some way to get it to work, since, at the end, AI right now is still just a tool.

## VI. Comparative Analysis

A good traditional comparison to AI might be a search engine since the main use of the two is similar. AI has the advantage of having a better understanding of the problem given and can generate a response based on it. However, the traditional search engine can provide things other people have written, and sometimes that is more valuable. You can also be more sure of the information and its accuracy most of the time. Although sometimes it can be better to use them together like getting info from AI first, then double-checking it on google.

## VII. Future Considerations

One good way to use AI in future teaching is as a personal tutor of sorts, where it can answer student specific questions. However, a really clear problem is that this can encourage students to use the AI to get the answer without going through any learning process. Some changes are definitely necessary, either with the AI or the teaching system. Maybe a change in less emphasis on grades, so the students aren't encouraged to use AI for answers only, or maybe make it so the AI can only give a set amount of responses to encourage students to only ask questions when they are really stuck. 

## VIII. Conclusion

Overall, I feel like AI is a really useful tool that has been really limited as of now in the education area. It should be used as a tool, and the current teaching styles should change to adapt to it instead of trying to only limit it or prohibit it. AI, as a tool if used properly, can be a really nice option for both students and teachers in the future.
