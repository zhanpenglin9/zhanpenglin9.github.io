## What is a Stupid Question and a Smart Question?

What is a stupid question? Is there such a thing as a stupid question? My answer to this question is always yes, since I've seen some questions that have left me speechless over the years. However, after reading and studying over the subject I've learned that this subject goes a lot deeper than what I first thought. 

From what I have learned from Eric Steven Raymond's writing, what a stupid question is more than just the problem you're asking. It also includes the way you ask it, the knowledge and your attitude toward the question. 

A stupid question is not only the information contained in the question but also how you present it. Things like the grammar and the way you title the questions also matters. Titles that have useless information like "please help" or "need help!" are not recommended as they can waste time. Also having words like urgent can be viewed as being rude and impolite. Poor grammar can also be a big problem as it shows you are a sloppy person and might now be worth people's time helping. 

As for the actual content of the question, it shouldn't be unclear and shouldn't be a block of words. It should include first the goal you're trying to accomplish then the steps you've taken and attempted so far. You should also include things like where you encounter the problem like what software you're using and what version it's on. 

You should also make it so there's an easy way to reply to your question. You shouldn't ask them to email you the answer unless you have a reason like the information needs to stay classified. 

## When and Where to Ask the Question?

Besides the content of the question, when you should ask the question also matters. You should only go and ask a question when you know you've done all that you could. Such as things like reading the manual and doing research yourself. This is so you've shown that the question you're asking isn't already easily accessible and that you're not wasting other people's time.

Besides that you also need to ask the question in an appropriate place. Asking the question at the wrong place or forum can cause your question being removed or being shown to the wrong person.

## Example: Good Question

[Example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79759524/ios-26-disable-uinavigationbar-titleview-automatic-color-inversion)

Q: iOS 26 Disable UINavigationBar titleView automatic color inversion

Is it possible to disable automatic color inversion in iOS 26 UINavigationBar which is triggered by the system depending on background? Can't find any new method in documentation for that.

This is a good question since the title of the post is straight to the point and professional. It includes the version of iOS they were using and what they were trying to do. In the actual post they included the goal they were trying to accomplish and the steps they've taken so far. They also showed that they have done their own research before this like checking in the documentations.

## Example: Bad Question 

<img width="200px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="../img/Eo_circle_red_letter-x.svg.png">

[Example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79759544/extract-data-from-pdf-and-convert-them-to-class)

Q: Extract Data From Pdf and Convert them To Class

I Extract data from Pdf and I want to convert them to into an class so how to do I have big Messy Data and how to work with this messy Data and then Convert them into python class

I use Pydantic class in python for this but that didnt work

This is an example of a bad question since one the content of the actual question is unclear. It does not clearly state the goal they were trying to accomplish. Neither did it clearly state the steps they tried so far, instead only describing it as "Messy Data". It is also hard to read since they have many grammar errors in the question. This a great example of what not to do when asking a question and a great way to get ignored as proven with the question getting no response in Stack.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, when trying to ask a question the way you ask it is really important. You need to make sure it is clearly stated with the right details included. It should be professional and straight to the point. It should be easy to reply to the post and shouldn't have anything that can be considered as rude like the term "urgent". The question should include where the problem is happening like what software you are using and what version it's on. The question should show you have done your part in trying to solve the question and that you are worth the time answering the question. It shouldn't have things like grammar issues and other things that show you don't care much about the problem yourself.

Overall, when asking a smart question one should follow the guidelines listed on top and be prepared to be ignored or their question being removed from forums when they don't. When it comes to asking a question, how you're asking is just as important as what you're asking.
