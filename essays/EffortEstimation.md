This is the first time I've heard of the concept of design patterns. The concept is really interesting, and I can see how it can be useful when facing different issues while coding. Using different design patterns can help make the coding process a lot smoother and easier. It can also help you recreate many objects and functions for later use when facing similar problems you've encountered before.<br><br><br><br><br><br>


## Ueses of Design Patterns

The primary purpose of a design pattern is to simplify the process of designing objects and functions by reusing design ideas for common coding problems. It can be used to provide inspiration on how to design one's own code for a common problem and how to improve one's code. It can also be used to provide a different perspective on a problem and find a more effective solution. They are templates for different problems and overall ideas on how you can solve them.

## Examples of Design Patterns

When it comes to design patterns, they can be separated into 3 different types: creational, structural, and behavioral. With creational being how to create objects, structural being how to represent and organize them, and behavioral being how they should interact with each other. Some examples of these can be of the Factory Pattern for creational patterns, which helps in creating objects without specifying the exact class. Two, the Adapter Pattern for structural patterns, which allows incompatible interfaces to work together. And three the Observer Pattern for behavioral patterns, which lets objects communicate changes to each other automatically.

## Application in Web Design

An example of the idea of design patterns in web design can be seen in frameworks like Bootstrap 5, where many of the prebuilt components and styles are solutions to common problems, such as creating responsive layouts or consistent UI elements. In a similar way, software design patterns offer reusable solutions to recurring coding problems. Another example can be the WODs that we did of trying to recreate different web pages. Even though the WODs are trying to recreate the webpage one to one, the prossess of doing so and the common issues we needed to fix can be an example of using desgin patterns. 

## Overall View

Overall, design patterns are a really useful concept for programers to use. It can be use to help provide intuition to different problems being face and provide make the programming prossess a lot more smoother. It can also help you translate old work from past projects to new programs and applications, saving a lot of time and effort. All in all, design patterns are a great tool and can help save a lot of headaches while programming.
