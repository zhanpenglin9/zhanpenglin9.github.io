## Overview (including “The problem” and “The solution”)
The problem: Currently the Enterprise Technology Services gets monthly reports from the state’s Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) vendors through a pdf in an email attachment. There is no standard format for the reports across vendors, leading to different information and dashboards.

The solution: Create a web application to standardize the information the vendors are sending and automate the creation of the reports. The vendors can submit their report’s information on the website and the ETS will review the report information for publication.

## The proposers
State of Hawai‘i - Office of Enterprise Technology Services

## Mockup page ideas
* Home
  * Dashboard page for public
  * Search feature using ai
* Login Page
* Admin page (For ETS employees)
  * Edit page / annotation page
  * Approval page
  * Make vendor account page / make other ETS employees page
* Vendor page
  * Submission form page
  * Have them summarize the description with AI
  * Edit page
* Error page
  * not found or server error, restricted access pages

## Use case ideas
The completed use case should show an end-to-end scenario of using the system.
* General public goes to landing page, look at IV&V dashboards
* Vendor goes to landing page, logs in, enters IV&V report data
* ETS goes to the landing page, logs in, approves or edits vendor submitted information.

## Beyond the basics
When the new user goes to the landing page, logs in, they get the home page, and set up their profile. (How do they learn how the system works?)
* Adding a “help” page
* Adding profile pictures is a 3rd milestone thing (soups low priority)
* “Forgot your password?” is a 3rd milestone feature
