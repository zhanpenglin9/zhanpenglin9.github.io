This is the final project I had to do for my high school coding class, and it was my introduction to coding a big project. 

The assignment had us create a text adventure game with what we learn that semester about Python. We made the game in a coding Integrated Development Environment website called [Replit](https://replit.com/). I was able to complete the project in about 3 weeks. 

This project gives me a chance to experience how it feels to work on a larger coding project. It helped me learn the importance of organizing my code and how creating multiple smaller functions for a single purpose can make life a lot easier. I also got a chance to design my own code instead of trying to create a program based on given instructions. 

Looking back at it now, the code definitely has a lot of things I can do better at, and it was still a bit of a mess organization-wise. But it was the first time I had a chance to work on a more personal project, and also the thing that really boosted my interest in coding.  

This is a part of the code I use in the project:
