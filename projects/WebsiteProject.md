This is one of the projects I did for my coding class back in high school. This was also my introduction to HTML and coding in general. We were given around 2 weeks to make a website for a shop. 

We use an IDE website called [replit](https://replit.com/) to design the website in HTML. This project got me familiar with how to code in HTML and experience some of the advantages and disadvantages of using HTML. Like how HTML allows for a high amount of customization, but also can be tedious at times for a user of the language.

The website I made was simple since it was my first time working with HTML and designing a website. I learn a lot about web design and during this project, and about what to do and what not to when designing a site. Things like what can become a distraction for a user of the site, and how to help the user navigate the site.
