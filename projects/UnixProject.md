This is a project I did back in ICS 212. The coding and implementation weren't done in an IDE but with the command prompt at the Unix server UH provided us with. This was a really interesting experience for me since this was my first class where we had to code outside of an IDE.

The project had us create a user interface with 5 options:

  1. Add - add an account with a name and an address
  2. Find - find a certain account and print it
  3. Printall - Print all accounts
  4. Delete - delete an account
  5. Quit - end the program

We had to implement each of the following functions, as well as make sure we have a way to save all the non-deleted data when we boot up the program after we end it.

This project gives me a chance to work with Unix and C in a way where I can actually test what I've learn and what I still need to work on. We had to work with a few different files and compile them together to make our program. We also went over how to implement a debug mode in the program. 

Overall, it really helped me understand coding in a Unix environment a lot more and how coding with an older coding language like C feels like.

This is a part of the code I use in the project:
